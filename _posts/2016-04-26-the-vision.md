# The Vision 

That of excitement and anticipation, of students and teacher alike looking forwards to entering the creative universe George provides them. For there they will together gradually discover how much is possible, how much they can learn and master, how much they can discover and create, and how they can accelerate the process through communication, sharing, cooperation. That of students discussing technical, scientific, and creative issues with each other and with their teachers when at school. We envision students sharing their achievements with their friends and family when not at school. That of unexpected solutions to unsolved problems emerging - both social and economic, scientific, and cultural. We envision a bright future.
